SOAP OIL**, totaling **150**, appears **four times**, indicating a significant risk of overpayment.\n- Similarly, the **invoice number 10409/2022-23** from **Fab Dairy & Trading (I) Pvt. Ltd.**, amounting to **1985.00**, is also duplicated **four times**, highlighting the need for further scrutiny.\n- Other notable duplicates include:\n  - The **invoice SSA/5514/22-23** from **Sun Shine Agencies** with a total of **21324.00**, duplicated **twice**.\n  - The **invoice INV-3337** from **DEMO - Sliced Invoices**, totaling **93.50**, also appearing **twice**.\n\n> These findings underscore the importance of implementing a robust **duplicate detection process** to maintain **financial accuracy** and **integrity** within the database.",
