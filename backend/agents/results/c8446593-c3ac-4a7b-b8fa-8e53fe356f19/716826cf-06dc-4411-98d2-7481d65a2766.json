      "ai_summary": "## Duplicate Invoice Analysis\n\n### Key Findings\n- A total of **11 unique invoices** have been recorded across various **vendors**.\n- The **total amount** processed from these invoices is **$16,865.98** with an **average invoice value** of **$1,533.27**.\n- **Duplicate counts** show that there are invoices with **2 to 3 duplicates** detected, indicating potential errors in invoice submissions.\n\n### Notable Trends\n- The vendor **Your Company LLC** and **Your company name** have invoices that may require scrutiny due to similar naming and potential for duplicate payments.\n- Highest individual invoice amount recorded is **$10,821.63**, which is significantly above the average, suggesting a critical area for validation.\n\n### Anomalies\n- The invoice **number INV-3337** appears linked with a **duplicate count** of **3**, indicating that it may have been submitted multiple times.\n- Several vendors, including **meat Hub** and **ABHIRUCHI SEAFOODS**, have invoices with a **duplicate count** of **3**, which could lead to overpayments if not addressed.\n\n### Business Impact\n> ⚠️ Duplicate invoices pose a risk of overpayment and affect cash flow management. Immediate action is recommended to validate these records to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Recommendations\n1. **Prioritize Review** of invoices with a duplicate count of **3** or more, particularly focusing on vendor **DEMO - Sliced Invoices** and **meat Hub**.\n2. **Implement Validation Checks** to automatically flag invoices that match on **invoice number**, **vendor**, and **amount** to mitigate risks of duplicate payments.\n3. **Conduct Training Sessions** for accounts payable staff to raise awareness about the importance of verifying invoice submissions to prevent future duplicates.\n\n### Conclusion\nAddressing the identified duplicates in the invoice dataset is essential to maintain financial integrity and ensure accurate vendor payments. The findings highlight specific areas for improvement in the invoice management process."
